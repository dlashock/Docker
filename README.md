# 🐳 Docker Learning Project (via Boot.dev)

This repository contains materials and exercises completed as part of the **Docker course on Boot.dev**. I created this repo to document my learning and build hands-on experience with containerization fundamentals—an essential part of modern DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) workflows.

## 📚 About the Course

The Boot.dev Docker course covers the basics of:
- What Docker is and why it's used
- Creating and managing containers
- Building Docker images
- Writing `Dockerfile`s
- Networking and volume management
- Best practices for containerized environments

## 🎯 Why I Took This Course

I completed this course as part of my ongoing journey to transition into a **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)** role. Understanding Docker is critical for:
- Deploying and managing microservices
- Building reliable and reproducible environments
- Integrating with Kubernetes and CI/CD pipelines

## 📌 Note

This repository is **not a boot.dev official project** but rather a personal record of educational progress. All material and configurations are intended for learning purposes.
